when you are in a jouerny to a beautiful beach, or an adventure trip to forested mountains you need to verify that your transport, in this case your car, is safe.
One of the most important things to check after or during your journey is the state of your tyres. 
This issue can be detected when you start a car, or when you are in the middle of your journey, so the first thing to do is to identify a damge tyre

If a tyre is damge, you need to follow the next steps:
 
- First you loose the tyre with the cross key. This is because you need a mechanical restrain to help you in this process
- Then you lift the car with the mechanical jack in order to replace the tyre for a new one
- Tight slightly the new tyre in the car
- Lower the car to the floor and thight the tyre
