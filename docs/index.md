# Welcome to Apollo

<b> *Apollo: Open Education From Everybody To  Anybody, annywhere* </b>

<div  style="text-align: justify;">
Education inequality is a sad reality we face. With the creation of new technologies and the internet anybody in the world can access information, but most of the time this information is either too advanced or too basic.  Apollo is a free website that allows the creation and sharing of tutorials in any language. Anybody can contribute. The users of Apollo can access at their own pace and they can learn whatever subject they wish.

During this COVID-19 times even “main-stream” education has been affected, Apollo comes just in time, in order to allow people from any institutions to contribute in order to share their classes with students, and if they wish with the rest of the world. 

This combination of humanity and technology  with a interdisciplinary teams, should eliminate or lessen a systemic issue and educate the user so they can grow.
