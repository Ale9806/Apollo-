# Tutorial 1

## Template for a Math class on the Web page

### Adding Topic _Basic Implementation of Math tutorials_

In this pages you can modify different aspects, such as creatin lists

* `Pitagoras Theorem` 
* `Lorentz Attractor` 

## Subsections

    The Lorentz attractor is a form for teaching the chaos in systems
    The pitagoras Theorem is an cnient theorem about rectangle triangles


In the next section. an example of a [jupyter notebook](https://jupyter.org/). 
Also note that we can use hyperlinks with this template to acces to different resources. 
The advantages of using jupyter notebooks is the implementation of different programs as we will see in latter lesssons and templates.
